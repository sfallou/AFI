	    • The smoke detector Status Indicator is red (does not flash).
    (j) Set the Rotary switch to COM D. 1 RESULT:
	• The ALARM C indicator is OFF.
	• The ALARM D indicator flashes ON and OFF.
	• The audio alarm is OFF.
	• The smoke detector Status Indicator is red (does not flash).
    (k) On the Manual Test Set, set the switches that follow:
	• Rotary - COM A
	• SELF TEST - OFF.
    WARNING:
    THE NOISE FROM THE PROCEDURE THAT FOLLOWS IS MORE THAN THE LIMIT THAT CAN CAUSE HEARING DAMAGE OR LOSS. PUT ON THE APPROVED HEARING PROTECTION BEFORE STARTING THE EQUIPMENT USED IN THE PROCEDURE THAT FOLLOWS. MAKE SURE THE PROTECTIVE DEVICE IS FITTED CORRECTLY TO REDUCE THE SUSTAINED NOISE LEVELS TO BELOW 90 DECIBELS. THERE IS NO WAY TO RETURN TO NORMAL HEARING ONCE THE DAMAGE HAS OCCURRED.
 (l) Spray simulated smoke into the labyrinth through the dust screen to make the detector go into alarm. While the smoke detector is in alarm, monitor the DMM and record the peak current.
1 RESULT:
• 210 mA maximum.
• The audio alarm can be heard.
• On the Manual Test set, the ALARM A indicator is ON (does not flash).
(m) While the smoke detector is in alarm (use more simulated smoke, if necessary), set the Manual Test Set Rotary switch to COM B.
1 RESULT
• The ALARM A indicator is OFF.

• The ALARM B indicator is ON (does not flash). • The audio alarm can be heard.
(n) On the Manual Test Set, set the HORN CANCEL switch to ON. 1 RESULT: Audio alarm is OFF.
(o) Set the HORN CANCEL switch to OFF.
(p) Wait until the smoke clears from the labyrinth (status indicator is green) before you do the next step.
(q) On the Manual Test Set, set the switches that follow:
 (11) Do
• Rotary - any position except COM A, COM B, COM C or COM D • PWR - OFF.
the audio alarm test as follows:
(a) On the Manual Test Set, set the PWR switch to ON. Wait until the status indicator is green before you do the next step.

PUT ON THE APPROVED HEARING PROTECTION BEFORE STARTING THE EQUIPMENT USED IN THE PROCEDURE THAT FOLLOWS. MAKE SURE THE PROTECTIVE DEVICE IS FITTED CORRECTLY TO REDUCE THE SUSTAINED NOISE LEVELS TO BELOW 90 DECIBELS. THERE IS NO WAY TO RETURN TO NORMAL HEARING ONCE THE DAMAGE HAS OCCURRED.
KEEP THE HEAT SOURCE AT LEAST 1.00 IN. (2.54 CM) AWAY FROM THE SMOKE DETECTOR. TOO MUCH HEAT CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE SMOKE DETECTOR HOUSING AND INTERNAL COMPONENTS.
  (b) Use the heat gun to blow hot air into the smoke detector housing/screen assembly. Point the heat gun so the air goes into the hole over the temperature sensor (Refer to DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION, Figure 2). Keep the tip of the heat gun at least 1.00 in. (2.54 cm) away from the smoke detector.
(c) Monitor the temperature at the surface of the smoke detector (near the hole over the temperature sensor) until the smoke detector alarms:
• Status indicator is red (does not flash) • The audio alarm can be heard.
1 RESULT: The temperature must be more than 212 °F (100 °C).
(d) Use the heat gun, at the cool air setting, to blow cool air on the smoke detector.
1 RESULT: The smoke detector goes out of alarm in approximately 30 seconds:
• Status indicator is green (does not flash) • The audio alarm is off.
(e) On the Manual Test Set, set the PWR switch to OFF.
(f) Disconnect the smoke detector from the test equipment.
